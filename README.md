# ANN-based-Condition-Monitoring
ANN-ConditionMon is an intelligent condition-monitoring and remaining useful life prediction framework for rotating machinery, combining wavelet packet signal processing and artificial neural networks. Designed for vibration-based health monitoring, and predicts future system health and failure horizons.
